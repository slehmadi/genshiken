    v "I have a news that I wanted to tell you."

    j "What is it?"

    v "It’s a big secret of mine, so will you keep this information a secret?"

    j "Of course. Why would I betray one of my best friends?"
    j "What are you hiding?"
    j "You’re acting really strange."

    v "Well then, are you paying attention to the video call?"

    j "Why would you tell me that?"

    j "That’s true, but what if someone else did that?"

    w "You’re the only one who has seen my face, so that secret is still hidden."

    j "So I’m the first one to see your face?"

    w "Yep, and probably the last one too."

    j "Why do you trust me so much?"

    #show darren happy
