    i "That University is known for its hard tests. How do you balance work and study?"

    j "I have made a fixed schedule for streaming and studying so that I’m not left behind in my study and can still stream."

    #show dummyJ smile #show callista happy

    j "I loved to watch many VTuber. I often watch their streams in my free time. I’m inspired to be like one of them and stream to an audience."
    j "I wanted to create a loving audience and entertain them. I also love to play games and sometimes make music."

    voice "<from 33 to 38>audio/Dubs/Interviewer/Scene 1_Interviewer_Final.mp3"

    voice "<from 40 to 48.8>audio/Dubs/Interviewer/Scene 1_Interviewer_Final.mp3"

    j "The pandemic has impacted my life a lot."
    j "I have a harder time studying than I normally do. At college, it’s hard for me to find a new friend. I didn’t have many chances of talking to any of my classmates outside of class."

    #show dummyJ smile #show callista happy

    j "I’m glad I have a best friend, Lucky that’s always by my side. Also, he’s the one who made my VTuber model. You all should check her out."

    j "Despite all of that, I’m glad of the chances that appear because of the pandemic."
    j "Because I spent a lot more time inside, I started to think that I shouldn’t waste all of this free time, so I started to stream as a VTuber. Without it, I won’t be the VTuber that I am now."
    
    voice "<from 50 to 57.5>audio/Dubs/Interviewer/Scene 1_Interviewer_Final.mp3"
    i "Such a lovely story we heard today. I think everyone should be inspired by Callista to not waste their time and use it to better ourselves."

    i "So that’s it for today's interview. Thank you, Callista, for coming here today. See you all next time on Nico Show!"
